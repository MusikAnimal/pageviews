You will have to rely on other tools such as <a href='http://stats.grok.se'>stats.grok.se</a> to view data older than this.

	"faq-chart-type-title": "How can I change the chart type?",
	"faq-chart-type-body": "Click \"$1\" to choose amongst 6 different types. The app will remember your preference. By default, the application will show a bar chart when viewing data for a single page, and a line chart for multiple pages.

	"faq-topviews-data-approx-title": "The data seems slightly off",
	"faq-topviews-data-approx-body": "The $1 only provides the most viewed pages on a per-day basis. Topviews Analysis works by querying data for the top 1000 viewed pages for each day in the given date range, then giving you the sum of this data. This means that if a certain page was not in the top 1000 at some point during the given date range, the total views you see might be inaccurate. For the top 10 most viewed pages, this usually is a trivial difference, but the further you go down the list the more inaccurate the data might become.",
	"faq-topviews-false-positive-title": "Why do some random pages have such high view counts?",
	"faq-topviews-false-positive-body1": "These are <strong>false positives</strong>, and unfortunately they are unavoidable. These could surface because someone used an automated program to scrape the page, for instance. One tactic to identify false positives is to compare desktop views with mobile web. Mobile web views should be comparable if not higher than desktop, so if mobile web views are very low, it might be a false positive.",
	"faq-topviews-false-positive-body2": "You can also open a page in the Pageviews app for further analysis. Just click on the view count on the right side. The data you see here is accurate. If there's an unusual spike in traffic, the Wikimedia Analytics team might be able to explain it.",

	"faq-massviews-sources-quarry": "is the numeric ID and project of a $1 dataset. The <code>$2</code> column (required) is what will be used as the page titles.",
	"faq-massviews-subject-page-title": "What is the \"$1\" option?",
	"faq-massviews-subject-page-body": "This option is for when you are using a category as the source. In some cases the category may contain talk pages when you actually want the subject pages. For instance <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:FA-Class_New_York_City_articles'>FA-Class New York City articles</a>, which lists the talk pages of FA-quality articles within WikiProject New York City.",
	"faq-throttle-wait-title": "Why do I have to wait $1 seconds before I can use the tool a second time?",
	"faq-throttle-wait-body": "The Wikimedia Pageviews API can only handle so many requests during a window of time. In order to ensure the API does not fail and you get all the data you need, you are forced to wait $1 seconds after using the tool before you can use it again.",
