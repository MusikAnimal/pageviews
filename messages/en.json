	"faq-topviews-false-positive-title": "Why do some random pages have such high view counts?",
	"faq-topviews-false-positive-body1": "These are <strong>false positives</strong>, and unfortunately they are unavoidable. These could surface because someone used an automated program to scrape the page, for instance. One tactic to identify false positives is to compare desktop views with mobile web. First see which agents are most popular on your project for all articles, and use that as a basis for comparison for pages you believe may be false positives. For instance on the English Wikipedia mobile web views should be comparable if not higher than desktop, so if mobile web views are very low, it might be a false positive.",

To do this, first exclude the page from view by hovering over it and clicking the ✖ in the beginning of the line. Then click on the '$2' link above the '$3' input.
